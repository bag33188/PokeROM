Through exciting exploration, battles, and trades, Trainers are able to access 150 Pok\u00E9mon. You begin your journey in Pallet Town as a young boy. After a dangerous brush with wild Pok\u00E9mon, Professor Oak teaches you how to capture Pok\u00E9mon, and then sends you on your way as a fledgling Trainer. During your journey through Kanto, you must capture Pok\u00E9mon to record their information in your Pok\u00E9dex, as well as become a better Trainer by competing in Gyms scattered throughout the region. Once you've proven your mettle as a Pok\u00E9mon Trainer, it's time to take on the Elite Four, a crack group of Trainers that will put all of your learned skills to the test. Your journey will be far from easy. In addition to the many Trainers and wild Pok\u00E9mon you'll encounter along the way, you'll also have to be watchful of Team Rocket, a despicable group of Pok\u00E9mon thieves. Prevent Team Rocket from stealing rare Pok\u00E9mon and stop their criminal ways! You won't be able to catch every Pok\u00E9mon in either Pok\u00E9mon Red or Pok\u00E9mon Blue; to collect every Pok\u00E9mon, you'll have to trade with friends via the Game Link™ Cable. With it, you can also take your team of faithful Pok\u00E9mon into battle against your pals to see how well your team stacks up! There's much to see and do in Pok\u00E9mon Red and Pok\u00E9mon Blue.

Explore the lakes, forests, and mountains of the Sinnoh region, seeking out Pok\u00E9mon such as the Bug-type Kricketot or the hard-headed Rock- and Steel-type Shieldon. And if you're lucky, you might bump into Legendary Pok\u00E9mon Palkia or Dialga! There are more than 490 Pok\u00E9mon in Pok\u00E9mon Diamond and Pok\u00E9mon Pearl. But be on the lookout for Team Galactic, a dastardly group that is trying to kidnap Pok\u00E9mon. Pok\u00E9mon RPGs have never looked better than they do in Pok\u00E9mon Diamond and Pok\u00E9mon Pearl. 3-D graphics bring the land of Sinnoh to life! And realistic lighting casts the land in sun or darkness depending on the time of day. However, there's more to daylight than just graphics—some Pok\u00E9mon will only show their faces during certain times of day, so you'll have to explore morning, noon, and night if you want collect them all! Everywhere you look, gameplay has been revamped thanks to the awesome abilities of the Nintendo DS system. With two screens, you can watch the action on one screen while monitoring the health of your Pok\u00E9mon on the other. The touch screen is used in a number of ways: You can use it to select moves in battle, to perform in Contests, or while exploring underground. And with the cool Trainer wristwatch, the Pok\u00E9tch, you can keep tabs on all kinds of important data during your adventure. The Underground is formed by a series of subterranean passages below Sinnoh that hold untold numbers of treasures for you to find. But there's more to the Underground than just spelunking—you can meet up with other Trainers while you're down there, and you can create a Secret Base for people to visit!",

You'll be able to go on your journey as a boy or a girl, and you can choose how your hero looks overall! Find a look that suits you, and then set off on your travels! Your adventure takes place in the expansive Kalos region, where you'll explore cities, meet people, and encounter many Pok\u00E9mon. Don't miss Lumiose City, the central hub of the region, where you'll return many times on your journey. Look for all-new Fairy-type Pok\u00E9mon, the first new Pok\u00E9mon type since Dark-type and Steel-type Pok\u00E9mon were introduced almost a decade ago.

Feed, pet, and play with your Pok\u00E9mon to increase your bond. The more you play with your Pok\u00E9mon, the friendlier they'll become—and perhaps perform better for you in battle. Around the Kalos region, you'll meet a lot of people. First there's the brilliant Professor Sycamore. He's researching Pok\u00E9mon, and he's looking to you and your friends for help. He may even challenge you to a battle from time to time. But you're also likely to encounter members of the mysterious organization Team Flare. What they're up to is anyone's guess. In Pok\u00E9mon X and Pok\u00E9mon Y, some Pok\u00E9mon will tap into powers long dormant. This special kind of Evolution is called Mega Evolution. In addition to far greater strength, Mega-Evolved Pok\u00E9mon may also see their Ability change, or even their type!",

Fairy-type moves are super effective against Dragon-type Pok\u00E9mon. One such Fairy-type Pok\u00E9mon to meet is Sylveon, the new evolved form of Eevee! All-new battle formats are fun for new players and Pok\u00E9mon pros. Sky Battles feature duels between Pok\u00E9mon that can fly, and Horde encounters are massive competitions where one of your Pok\u00E9mon faces many wild Pok\u00E9mon at once! These new modes will challenge every Pok\u00E9mon Trainer. In addition to new battle types, you can also care for your Pok\u00E9mon with the Pok\u00E9mon-Amie feature. Feed, pet, and play with your Pok\u00E9mon to increase your bond. The more you play with your Pok\u00E9mon, the friendlier they'll become—and perhaps perform better for you in battle. Around the Kalos region, you'll meet a lot of people. First there's the brilliant Professor Sycamore. He's researching Pok\u00E9mon, and he's looking to you and your friends for help. He may even challenge you to a battle from time to time. But you're also likely to encounter members of the mysterious organization Team Flare. What they're up to is anyone's guess. In Pok\u00E9mon X and Pok\u00E9mon Y, some Pok\u00E9mon will tap into powers long dormant. This special kind of Evolution is called Mega Evolution. In addition to far greater strength, Mega-Evolved Pok\u00E9mon may also see their Ability change, or even their type!",

      "description": "Experience an epic journey through a world filled with Pok\u00E9mon in Pok\u00E9mon Omega Ruby and Pok\u00E9mon Alpha Sapphire for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems. Pok\u00E9mon fans first enjoyed Pok\u00E9mon Ruby and Pok\u00E9mon Sapphire when it launched in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance. A whole new generation of Pok\u00E9mon fans will experience the dramatic story line that unfolds in Pok\u00E9mon Omega Ruby and Pok\u00E9mon Alpha Sapphire. Your adventure takes place in Hoenn, a region that consists of a main island that stretches widely from east to west along with countless islets that dot the deep blue sea around it. A live volcano steams constantly in the heart of this green-covered island. Look forward to a region rich with natural beauty, a variety of Pok\u00E9mon, and extraordinary people. Among those folks is Pok\u00E9mon Professor Birch, who runs the Pok\u00E9mon Lab in Littleroot Town. With him, you will have your first meeting with the Pok\u00E9mon that will become your partner on your journey, and a new bond will be born. You’ll also encounter incredibly tough Trainers during your journey and visit Pok\u00E9mon Gyms, where Pok\u00E9mon Trainers gather and Gym Leaders stand ready for Trainers to challenge them. As the story unfolds, you will battle Team Magma in Pok\u00E9mon Omega Ruby and Team Aqua in Pok\u00E9mon Alpha Sapphire. Led by Maxie, Team Magma seeks to expand the land, while Archie and Team Aqua wish to expand the seas. In order to bring about these grand plans, each will turn to the power of a Legendary Pok\u00E9mon: Groudon or Kyogre. Team Magma pursues Groudon, while Team Aqua goes after Kyogre. What could be driving them to such lengths? These Legendary Pok\u00E9mon also undergo an event called Primal Reversion to become Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. These Pok\u00E9mon play a great role in shaping the stories in which they each appear.",

The islands are teeming with Pok\u00E9mon, including some Alolan variants of familiar Pok\u00E9mon that were originally discovered in the Kanto region. During your adventure, you’ll have multiple run-ins with the troublesome Team Skull, encounter the elusive guardian deities, and unravel a plot surrounding the mysterious Aether Foundation.
