          You can view the API documentation by visiting
          <a href="{{ apiUrl }}/api/docs/{{ apiVersion }}" target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >. The documentation was generated with
          <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/" target="_blank">Swagger</a>. In
          these docs, you will find ways to make API requests to a various
          amount of endpoints.

        <ng-container>
          Some of the following HTTP verbs in those requests include:
          <ul>
            <li *ngFor="let httpVerb of httpVerbs">
              <code>{{ httpVerb }}</code>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <p>
          You will need to authenticate/authorize yourself if you wish to make
          requests to all of the
          <code>/api/roms</code> endpoints and most of the
          <code>/api/users</code> endpoints.
