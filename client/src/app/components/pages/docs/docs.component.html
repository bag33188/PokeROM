        <p>
          You can view the API documentation by visiting
          <a href="{{ apiUrl }}/docs/{{ apiVersion }}" target="_blank">here</a>.
          The documentation was generated with
          <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/" target="_blank">Swagger</a>. In
          these docs, you will find ways to make API requests to a various
          amount of endpoints.
        </p>
        <ng-container>
          Some of the following HTTP verbs in those requests include:
          <ul>
            <li *ngFor="let httpVerb of httpVerbs">
              <code>{{ httpVerb }}</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ng-container>
        <p>
          You will need to authenticate/authorize yourself if you wish to make
          requests to all of the
          <code>/api/roms</code> endpoints and most of the
          <code>/api/users</code> endpoints.
          <br />
          This API uses <strong>JWT</strong> (JSON Web Token) authentication,
          also known as a <strong>Bearer Token</strong>.

          >UI registration functionality not yet implemented, please use the
          method below for registering yourself as a new user.</span
        >
        <br />
        To register as a user, you must first visit the
        <strong>API Documentation</strong> page at
        <code>/api/docs/{{ apiVersion }}</code> (linked
        <a href="{{ apiUrl }}/docs/{{ apiVersion }}" target="_blank">here</a>).
        <br />
        There, you will you need to scroll down to the
        <strong>Users</strong> section and expand the
        <code>/api/users/register</code> section.
        <br />
        Then click the <kbd>Try it out</kbd> button.
        <br />
        You should then see a textbox with something like this in it:
        <br />
        <code class="json-code-block">
          {{
            '{\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name":"string",\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"email":"string",\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"username":"string",\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"password":"string"\r\n}'
          }}
        </code>
        <br />
        This is known as <strong>JSON</strong> (JavaScript Object Notation).<br />
        Now just replace the other
        <code>string</code> parts with your own information (remember to NOT
        delete the <b>&quot;</b>s). <br />Here's an example:<br />
        <code class="json-code-block">
          {{
            '{\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name":"John Doe",\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"email":"jdoe123@gmail.com",\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"username":"john_doe",\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"password":"12345678"\r\n}'
          }}
        </code>
        <br />
        Then click the <kbd>Execute</kbd> button.
        <br />
        Done! You are now registered as a user!
        <br />
        You should be able to login using that information and have all the core
        Pok&eacute;mon ROMs and the 2 ROM hacks (Pok&eacute;mon Prism and
        Pok&eacute;mon Ash Gray).
        <br />
        If you get any errors when registering, read what they are, and fix your
        data so that they match the registration criteria.
