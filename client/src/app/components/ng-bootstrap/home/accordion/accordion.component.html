        Every single ROM that you will see, download, or read about on this
        website has been dumped directly from its own cartridge.
        <br />
        For starters, to dump the GB and GBC ROMs, I used my N64 controller's
        Transfer Pak along with Raphet's
        <a [href]="raphnet().SOFTWARE" target="_blank"
          >Adapter Management tool</a
        >
        (using Raphnet's
        <a [href]="raphnet().PRODUCT" target="_blank">N64 to USB adapter</a>) to
        read and dump the ROM from the cartridge. <br /><br />
        Next, I used my R4 along with a GBA backup tool to dump the ROM on all
        GBA cartridges.
        <br /><br />
        For all NDS and 3DS core games, I used my CFW 3DS and GodMode9 to dump
        those ROMs from their respective cartridges.
        <br /><br />
        Finally, I recently hacked my Switch, and was thus able to dump the
        Pok&eacute;mon Lets Go Pikachu and Eevee ROMs.

      <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
        Absolutely! Each and every ROM is free and backed by a no-adware/virus
        guarantee!<br />You won't ever have to deal with those pesky installers
        or even survey scams.<br />This site contains direct download links
        only. All the ROMs come from my cloud database.
