It felt really kewl to actually take my knowledge and apply it to something that made me happy. 2 more months went by, and I was ready to launch it on the internet: for the world (well, just me actually) to see. That was one of the most memorable days of my life. I remember waking up at 1:30 am in the morning on an Amazon Rainforest cruise to start pushing my code to a production environment. I woke up so early because during the day we would be out on a small boat exploring the jungle. It took me over 5 hours with 2 kilobits of bandwidth in the middle of the Amazon to deploy my website. I\u2019ll never forget that day (June 17th, 2019). From then on, I went to buy my own domain, hosting server, and SSL certificates. It took me weeks just to figure out how all that worked. After all, I never had experience with that before then. Since those vivid days, I have run my own website that I have maintained for over a year. It is one of the only things that I am proud of when I think of my senior year in high school.
